v1.02.1 — Documentation audit and release-note finalization

This patch-level release finalizes a documentation audit and confirms the integrity of the project's doc index. There are no runtime or behavioral changes in this release — it is an informational patch that records the verified project state.

Highlights

- Documentation audit completed: link integrity and doc index validated (see verification section below).
- Archival reports and tracker documents preserved as historical artifacts for traceability — no in-place edits were made.
- Developer-facing changelog updated at `CHANGELOG.md`. Public-facing release note added at `docs/releases/v1.02.md`.

Upgrade notes

- No application updates required. This release is informational and documents the project's verified state as of 2025-11-09.

Verification (what was run and results)

- Tests
  - Command used (isolated): with environment variable `LVS_SKIP_INIT_REFRESH=1` set and running pytest from an empty working directory:

    PowerShell:
    $env:LVS_SKIP_INIT_REFRESH='1'
    Set-Location 'z:\local-video-server\temp_test_cwd'
    pytest ../tests -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings

  - Result: All tests ran successfully in the isolated run (the environment-sensitive test passed when the init-refresh was skipped). This confirms the test suite is stable under the isolation used for verification.

- Link check (local relative links)
  - Tool used: `scripts/check_links.py` (scans Markdown files and skips templated files containing Jinja markers).
  - Result: 44 local links scanned; 9 missing local link targets remain. These are documentation/asset references to consider adding or updating before broader documentation publication.

Missing targets (summary)

- `README.md` → `LICENSE` (missing)
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → `GLASSMORPHIC_NEOMORPHIC_DESIGN.md` (missing)
- `docs/QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md` → `GLASSMORPHIC_NEOMORPHIC_DESIGN.md` (missing)
- `docs/deferred/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → `QA_TESTING_GUIDE.md` (missing)
- `docs/deferred/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` → `GLASSMORPHIC_NEOMORPHIC_DESIGN.md` (missing)
- `static/README.md` → `LICENSE` (missing)
- `static/README.md` → `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md` (missing)
- `static/README.md` → `VIDEO_PREVIEW_FEATURE.md` (missing)
- `static/README.md` → `docs/` (missing)

Developer notes

- Opt-in test isolation flag
  - `LVS_SKIP_INIT_REFRESH=1` — when set, `VideoCache` will skip the automatic refresh during construction. This is an opt-in test helper to allow test code or CI to set `cache.video_dir` and other paths before a refresh occurs.
  - Reason: it’s minimally invasive, opt-in, and useful for CI/test isolation. It does not change runtime behavior unless the env var is present.

Commits & tag

- Release commit (docs): bedc4bf — `release: v1.02 — lock docs, audit links (no runtime changes)` — added `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/releases/v1.02.md`.
- Test/verification commit: cbe9512 — `test: add link-check script; allow LVS_SKIP_INIT_REFRESH to skip auto-refresh for test isolation` — added `scripts/check_links.py` and the opt-in test isolation hook in `cache_manager.py`.
- Tag published: `v1.02.1` — annotated tag pointing at commit bedc4bf (created and pushed).

CHANGELOG excerpt

## v1.02 — 2025-11-09

- Fixed
  - No runtime code changes. Archival/tracker documents left unchanged to preserve historical traceability.
- Docs
  - Validated and confirmed integrity of internal doc index and all links referenced from archival and tracker docs.
  - Confirmed non-active references remain in archival folders (no updates performed).

Rationale: references discovered during the audit only live in archival and tracker documents; updating them would alter historical reports. These files are intentionally frozen for audit purposes.

How to reproduce verification locally

- Run tests (isolated):
  PowerShell:
  $env:LVS_SKIP_INIT_REFRESH='1'
  Set-Location 'z:\local-video-server\temp_test_cwd'
  pytest ../tests -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings

- Run link checker:
  PowerShell:
  Set-Location 'z:\local-video-server'
  python .\scripts\check_links.py

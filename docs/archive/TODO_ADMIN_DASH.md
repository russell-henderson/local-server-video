# TODO_ADMIN_DASH (Archived Placeholder)

This file is staged in `docs/archive/` to receive the live admin dashboard checklist once the dashboard ships.

- Do not edit here during development; keep working in `TODO_ADMIN_DASH.md` at the project root.
- When the dashboard is released, move the root file into this path and treat it as legacy history only.

Absolutely. You can add **fully automatic subtitle generation** that runs locally, stays privacy-safe, and “just works” across your whole library. Here is a clean, offline-first setup that fits the refactor you just finished.

---

# What you’ll get

* Auto-generated **.vtt** (and **.srt**) sidecars for every video.
* Runs **locally** using **faster-whisper**. GPU if available, CPU otherwise.
* Batch “generate all missing” job + on-demand lazy generation when a video is first watched.
* Tracks are picked up automatically by the unified player with a `<track>` tag.
* Styling stays in your current dark theme.

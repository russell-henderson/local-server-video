Subtitle references scan
========================

Date: 2025-11-09
Total matches found (grep): 200+ (see list below)

Summary: the repository still contains references to "subtitle" across docs, templates, and a small set of compatibility shim files. Most remaining references are in archived docs under `docs/deferred/`, `docs/`, and in tasklists. Active code references left intentionally are:

- `subtitles.py` (compatibility shim)
- `manage_subs.py` (CLI stub)
- `static/subtitle-controls.js` (no-op stub)
- `static/css/subtitle-controls.css` (neutralized)
- `templates/_player.html` and `templates/watch.html` (player markup updated; comments remain)
- `main.py` (comment noting subtitle system removed)

Docs containing subtitle references (non-exhaustive):
- `docs/SUBTITLE_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/SUBTITLE_SYSTEM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `docs/SUBTITLE_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `docs/deferred/SUBTITLE_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`
- `docs/deferred/SUBTITLE_SYSTEM_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `docs/deferred/SUBTITLE_GENERATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `tasklist.md`
- `docs/tasklist.md`

Other files with subtitle mentions:
- `copilot_todo.md`
- `test_subtitles.py` (notice stub)
- `templates/best_of.html` (css class named "subtitle" used for layout)
- `static/css/app.css` (subtitle-overlay styles hidden)

Next recommended steps:
1. Decide if you want to fully purge the compatibility shims (`subtitles.py`, `manage_subs.py`, `static/subtitle-controls.js`) or keep them as safe no-ops until after the player-control feature lands and smoke tests pass.
2. If purging, remove the shims and update imports in files that reference `subtitles` or `config_subtitles.py` (search results show `tasklist.md` and some templates may reference the helper functions).
3. After purge, run the smoke-test (start Flask) and run `grep -Ri "subtitle" ./` to confirm only archived docs remain.

Full machine-readable results are available via the interactive grep run; ask me to export the exact match list if you want the complete per-line listing.
